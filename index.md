## Brief introduction

  I joined SYSU (School of Intelligent Systems Engineering) on 2020.  
  I am a member of *Hundred talents program of Sun Yat sen University*.  
  I was a postdoc in HKU (2016-2018) and in HKUST (2018-2020).  
  
  I am most interested in solving open problems that have clean definitions in theoretical computer sceicne. My current research area includes:  
     - **Computational Geometry**  
     - **Game Theory**  
     - **Algorithm Design**  
     - **Combinatorics**  
     - **Discrete and Convex Geometry**

## Education background
    B.S., Special Pilot CS Class (YAO class), Tsinghua University (2008）
    Ph.D, Theoretical Computer Science, Tsinghua University (2016)  
      My supervisor is Prof Andrew C. Yao.  

### PhD. Thesis
   
[**_When Convexity meets Parallelism – a New Geometric Structure and Its Application_**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03897)  
Supervised by Prof Andrew Yao and advised by Prof Haitao Wang.

## Submitted papers

- [**A Geometric Structure Associated with the Convex Polygon**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03897)  
*Comment: A small world is created here. It is my representative work!*

- [**A Technique for Solving the Polygon Inclusion Problems**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uyt4Xs4MFlVadWz64TD8tP73A8nHrfaW/view)

Among others, it presents an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm for finding Maximal Area Parallelogram.*

## Ongoing projects  
  1. I am looking for more applications of my technique for solving the polygon inclusion problems.  
  2. I am working with Prof Siu-Wing Cheng (HKUST) on *self-improving algorithms*.  
  3. I am revising some previous results given in conference papers (e.g. AAMAS'19, ISAAC'16).
  4. I am attracted by some open problems in game theory and will study them recently.
  I am particularly interested in cooperation and competition between multiple players.
  5. I am trying to extend the results given in my Phd. dissertation to the 3d case.
  6. I am working on several geometric optimization problems.

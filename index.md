## Ongoing papers

- [**A Geometric Structure Associated with the Convex Polygon**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03897)  
*Comment: A small world is created here. Strongly Recommanded!*

- [**Maximal Area Triangles in a Convex Polygon**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04071)  
*Comment: Computing the Maximal Area Triangle in a convex polygon is a very classic problem in geometric optimization in CG. Surprisingly, the previous known linear-time algorithm by Dobkin and Snyder (see their FOCS paper Here) for this problem is incorrect! This is recently discoverd by Keikha, Löffler, Urhausen, and Hoog [here], where redesigning a linear-time algorithm has been proposed as an open problem. I resolved it in this paper by presenting a linear-time algorithm which is simple and delightful.*

- [**Finding all Maximal Area Parallelograms in a Convex Polygon**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00181)  
*Comment: This paper is the full version of my CCCG11 paper.  
Among others, it presents an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm for finding Maximal Area Parallelogram.*

### Ongoing papers

- A Geometric Structure Associated with the Convex Polygon,  (Arxiv Here)

Comment: A small world is created here. Strongly Recommanded!

- Maximal Area Triangles in a Convex Polygon, (Arxiv Here)

Computing the Maximal Area Triangle in a convex polygon is a very classic problem in geometric optimization in CG. Surprisingly, the previous known linear-time algorithm by Dobkin and Snyder (see their FOCS paper Here) for this problem is incorrect! This is recently discoverd by Keikha, Löffler, Urhausen, and Hoog [here], where redesigning a linear-time algorithm has been proposed as an open problem. I resolved it in this paper by presenting a linear-time algorithm which is simple and delightful.

- Finding all Maximal Area Parallelograms in a Convex Polygon,  (Arxiv Here)

This paper is the full version of my CCCG11 paper.
Among others, it presents an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm for finding Maximal Area Parallelogram.

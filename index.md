## Brief Introduction

  I joined SYSU (School of Intelligent Systems Engineering) on 2020.  
  I am a member of *Hundred talents program of Sun Yat sen University*.  
  I was a postdoc in HKU (2016-2018) and in HKUST (2018-2020).  
  My research area includes:  
     - **Computational Geometry**
     - **Game Theory**
     - **Algorithm Design**
     - **Combinatorics**

## Education and Experience
    B.S., Special Pilot CS Class (YAO class), Tsinghua University (2008）
    Ph.D, Theoretical Computer Science, Tsinghua University (2016)  
      My supervisor is Prof Andrew C. Yao.  

### PhD. Thesis
   
[**_When Convexity meets Parallelism – a New Geometric Structure and Its Application in Finding the Maximal Parallelograms in Convex Polygons._**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03897)  
Supervised by Prof Andrew Yao and advised by Prof Haitao Wang.
